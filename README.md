# snake86
This project is a simple snake that is entirely written in x86-64 assembly.

## Requirements
GNU/Linux
nasm
ld

## Build and run
Run the `run` script in a real terminal, like those you can access with Ctrl+Alt+F1-12.
A terminal emulator won't suffice, as the program needs raw keyboard input.
